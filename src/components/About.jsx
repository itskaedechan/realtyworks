                "I love that small-town feeling that our community offers.
                Spectacular golf courses, parks, a pool, and easy access to Las
                Vegas make Pahrump a great place to call home. Working or
                retired, fast-paced or looking to relax... there's a place for
                you here! I enjoy living in the Mountain Falls community and
                will strive to find you a home that will suit you just as this
                community does me."
